This project demonstrates a basic implementation of Interceptors in Android using OkHttp and Retrofit.

Data is fetched from a remote API.

An Interceptor is integrated to log, monitor, and manipulate network requests/responses.

The fetched data is displayed in a simple list UI.

This example helps understand how interceptors can be applied for:

Adding custom headers

Logging API requests and responses
